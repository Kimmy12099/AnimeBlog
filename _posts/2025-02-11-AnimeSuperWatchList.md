title: Anime I REALLY Want To Watch
---

So, I got a few Anime that I REALLY want to watch, but don't until I have "the free time", or watch "when I am in perfect mood", but let's be real, none of those are going to happen for awhile. I really want to watch these anime cause I think they are anime that I will enjoy and can easily shoot up into the top 10-20 anime based on the plot and genre. This is Febuary 11 2025, and here are the anime that I really want to watch, and let's see if I finish them all by 2026.
