title: What Makes a good Anime for me 
---

What makes a good anime? This is a very subjective question where everyone's answer will be different. It could be the characters, the story, the plot, or just plain action Shounen --appeals to demographic the demographic of teens through action filled shows. For me, there are many different aspects that make a good anime and the following blog will cover my 5 big reasons in no specific order.   


# Reason 1 
The first reason is how well does the anime resonate with me or is the anime boring for me? Anime that reonante with me would be anime that create a nostolgic feel, like a show that includes any of my childhood hobbies such as quite literally any sport, or anything related to music. Relatability in anime is such as big factor for me when I am watching anime. For example, a show that is currently airing is Blue Box, and the main character(s) Taiki, Chinatsu, Hina all go to a sports school where they have to attend competitions. Both Chitasu and Hina are the best in their sports respectively -- basketball and gymnastics -- but it seems Taiki needs to catch up in his respective sport -- badminton. As someone who has played a bunch of sports (basketball, tennis mainly, handball, swimming, badminton, ping pong, cross country, track and field, baseball, softball, League technically haha esport =]), I can't help but get the burning sensation of competing again. Anyways, enough of Blue Box, cause that anime will definitely get a blog post later, this anime for me is too good I swear to god. It's probably top 20 (I'm going to mark it here, I am saying this, and currently 17 episodes have aired)

*Talk about anime boring to me 


# Reason 2
Animation (color, artstyle, increase or decrease in contrast)

# Reason 3
Plot (Pacing, dialouge, complex characters or complex stories that the anime message can be taken in multiple ways)
# Reason 4
Soundtrack
# Reason 5
Alright, this last point may feel really really dumb, but its just how I am currently feeling in life when I am watching an anime. Honestly, this is quite the wild card between all 5 of my reasons and I think has the most impact compared to the other 4 reasons. Generally, I tailor what I am watching in tandem to how I am feeling in life currently. This definitely affects how much the anime resonantes with me as well because when I am feeling down, I am more open to being able to feel emotions. For example, when I was feeling lost in life/depressed/anxious, I watch more Slice of Life shows that give me a light at the end of the tunnel, and push myself to work at least a bit towards my goals everyday. Shows I've watched during these times and have meant a lot to me were Your Lie in April, Yuru Camp, Hajime No Ippo, and A Place Further Than The Universe. However, if I am not feeling this way, these shows are not so great, and I generally find them really boring because as said above, I only open myself to feeling emotions when I am down. Some examples of shows that did not resonante with me, but I know that people enjoyed are Violet Evergarden, Tsukigakirei, and 5 Centimeters Per Second. When I am not feeling down, I still like to keep to myself, but I am highly motivated and disciplined, so I like to watch Shounen shows such as Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, and Jujutsu Kaisen.

 To me, it kind of feels lame to rate shows based on how I am currently feeling in life, but I can't get rid of this feeling when watching and rating anime. I wish I could find a way to remove that aspect when I am rating shows and give a logical rating of these shows based off the other reasons I suggested, but I cannot unforunately. I feel bad for shows like Violet Evergarden, which I know the meaning and philosophy behind the show (I only watched the first season, not the 2 movies by the way), and it is highly appliable to my life, but I can't apply it because I watched it at the wrong time in my life and I can't rewatch it because I know what happens already generally.
