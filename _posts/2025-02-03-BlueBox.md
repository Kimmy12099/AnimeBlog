title: BLUE BOXXXXXX
---

-Cute sports romance anime that blends both tropes 
-Research about sports and romance tropes and see if it applies to blue box 

-Love triangle trope, but it seems like you are cheering for both of the girls, cause they are both actual good humans instead of one being trashy and the other being perfect. Probably the best love triangle I've seen ever I've seen in anime in my little amount I've watched romance anime (explain hina and chinatsu character)
-Relatable to me because its sports, played both badminton and basketball before (before covid), and makes me want to compete again, but i guess this time I'll be trying my best at becoming a good dance 
-Played a bunch of sports in the past so this idea of "hard work to become the best" is very relatable 
-Pressure is also big relatability on Chinatsu's part because she is the ace of the team, so she is expected to perform. For me, every tennis competition I went to as a child, my coach expected me to be first every single time 

-Idk how to explain this one but theres a lot of cute moments, don't want to go into detail but makes my heart full 
-the visuals look really good, what intiailly drew me into the anime and the hype around the manga 
-Initially did not like the op and ed too much but now I play them nonstop even when I'm not watching the anime 

-Maybe talk about the symbolism in the anime (wings in the intro of part 2, ankle bracelet, why tf is the anime called "blue box?")

-A lot of emotions aren't expressed directly but by their facial expressions and body language 
-Episode 18 gave me chills (Yusa vs Taiki)
