I haven't blogged in a while huh. Well welcome to whoever is reading this, past or present Ian or someone else. I wanted to start an anime Youtube channel, but I think that's too much for me right now -- especially since I should be focusing on growing my first channel. Also, having a second channel is so much more work and editing on my plate, that if I wanted to run both smoothly, I would be solely focusing on content creation (and school/work) -- so this is the next best option in my opinion =). Who knows, maybe in the future, these blogs could turn into a channel?
